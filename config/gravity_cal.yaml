# Gravity compensation parameters for Z-Y-Z serial wrist
# These values represent the center of mass times mass (mu = m * r_cm) for each link
# in the link's local coordinate frame
# 
# You will need to calibrate these values for your specific wrist by:
# 1. Running gravity calibration routine with known poses
# 2. Measuring torques at each pose
# 3. Solving for the mu parameters
#
# Initial values are set to small non-zero values as a starting point
mus:
  # Link 1 (after Joint 1, Z-axis rotation)
  # Format: [mu_x, mu_y, mu_z] in kgâ‹…m

  # Link 2 (after Joint 2, Y-axis rotation)
